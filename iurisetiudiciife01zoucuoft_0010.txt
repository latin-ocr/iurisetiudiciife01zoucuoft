the origin or growth of the Law of Nations. The masterpieces
of Grotius will naturally be the central point in the series, but
the works of his leading predecessors and successors will likewise
be included. The text of each author will be reproduced photo-
graphically, so as to lay the source before the reader without the
mistakes which might creep into a newly printed text. In the
case of the early authors the photographed text will be accom-
panied by a revised 'text whenever that course shall seem de-
sirable. An Introduction will be prefixed to each work, giving
the necessary biographical details and stating the importance of
the text and its place in International Law3 tables of errata will
be added, and notes deemed necessary to clear up doubts and
ambiguities or to correct mistakes in the text will be supplied.
Variations in successive editions of the text published in the
author' s lifetime will be noted, but little or nothing m the nature
ot' historical commentary will be furnished.

Each work will be accompanied by an English version made
expressly for the series by a competent translator.

It is hoped that the series will enable general readers as well as
specialists to trace International Law from its faint and uncon—
scious beginnings to its present ample proportions ancl to forecast
with some degree of certainty its future development into that law
which Mirabeau tells us will one day rule the world.
