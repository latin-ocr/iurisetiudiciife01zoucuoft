Part II treats of “ Rights ’‘ in general (De Jure in qenere) in
relation to personae, res, and actus.

Part III is devoted to “ Private,'’ and Part IV to “ Public “
Law, in each case with reference to persons, things, obligations,
delicts‚ and duties. In Parts v-VII, we pass from Law and Rights
to the means by which Rights are enforced, namely by “Judicium‚’‘
in its successive stages of causae coynitio, decretum, and coercitio,
first in Private‚ and then in Public Law; in each case with refer-
ence to persons, things, obligations, delicts and duties. All these
topics are discussed in the phraseology of the Civil Law, often in
sentences taken textually from the Digest and Code. It must be
remarked that the work, after dealing fully with Private Law,
Public Law, and the Procedure applicable to each, ends some-
what abruptly‚ without adding a word to what had been said
in the First Part as to a communio inter diversos Principes et
Respublicas. It would rather seem that, although he had there
announced his intention of dealing with this topic, it was only at
a much later date, and perhaps not till he had carefully studied
the great work of Grotius, only very recently published when the
“ Elementa ’‘ was written.³¹÷ that Zouche seriously turned his at-
tention to it. So much of the general scheme of the “ Elementa ''
as relates to the Law, Public or Privatey which is enforced by
each State over those subject to its jurisdiction was worked out by
him. in detail, in the series of monographs which appeared in
rapid succession from 1634 to 1640: but it was not till 1650 that
he published anything upon the body of rules which govesn the
relations of each sovereign State to the rest. He had by then
utilized‚ as it would seem. a period of enforced leisure from Aca—
demical duties (“otio non alias felici ”), to complete, by the
“ Jus Fcciale‚‘’ the series of works contemplated twenty-one years
previously.

In the new work, We encounter all the distinctions and terms
with which the “ Elementa‚'‘ and the monographs which followed
it, had familiarized us 3 notably the distinction between “ Rights ''
