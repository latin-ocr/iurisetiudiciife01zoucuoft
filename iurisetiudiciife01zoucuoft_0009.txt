PREFACE.

The Carnegie Institution of VVashington bas undertaken the
republication of the leading classics of International Law and the
present volume, edited by the distinguished publicist Professor
Thomas Erskine HoIland, is the first of a comprehensive series.

One reason for the undertaking is the difficulty of procuring
the texts in convenient form for scientific study3 the libraries in
the United States have been searched with the result that few of
the earlier works were to be found. Another reason is that some
of the works selected for republication have never been trans-
lated into English. The American publicist is therefore at a
disadvantage in consulting works of admitted authority, and
when found they are, as it were, scaled books to all but trained
Latinists. The specialist is thus forced to rely upon summary
statements and references to them to be found in treatises on Inter-
national Law, or is driven to examine them in European Libra-
ries, often a difficult task, while the general reader is practically
barred from the stores of knowledge locked up in the earlier
works on the Law of Nations. The same difficulty exists in
Latin America, Japan, and in a lesser degree in many European
countries.

Eminent publicistsy European and American, who have been
consulted as to the usefulness of the plan to republish the Classics‚
have indorsed the project and have pledged their personal co-
operation. The works to be included in the series have not only
been approved but suggested by them, so that the undertaking is
international in scope, in selection‚ and in execution.

The underlying principle of selection has been to reissue those
works which can be said to have contributed either to the origin
or to the growth of International Law and the term classic has
been used in the broad rather than in the narrow sense, so that
no work will be omitted which can be said to have contributed to
