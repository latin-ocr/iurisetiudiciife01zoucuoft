an inscription in the College chapel. She alone of all Zouche’s
children, left issue. One of her daughters, Francos Lydall,
married Dr. W. &Yalken a fellow of Oriel‚ whose descendant, the
Revd. Edward R. Zouche W'alkcr„ still owns, with other family
treasures‚ the beautiful portrait of Zouche, by Cornelius Jansen,
representing him as a man of 33, in ruff and doublet, with refined
features and a pointed beard. ΜΓ. VValker has most kindly
allowed the original portrait to be reproduced as the frontispiece
of this volume.

The impression made by Zouche upon his contemporaries may
be gathered from Anthony VVood‚ who writes that he was: “ an
exact artist, a subtle logie-ian, expert historian, and for the knowl-
edge in, and practice of, the Civil Law, the chief person of his
time, as his works, much esteemed beyond the seas (where several
of them are rep rinted) partly testify. He was so well versed also
in the Statutes of the University‚ and controversies between the
members thereos and the City, that none after Twyne's death went
beyond him. As his birth was nobley so was his behaviour and
discourse, and as personable and handsome so naturally sweet‚
pleasing and affable. The truth is there was nothing wanting
but a froward spirit for his advancement3 but the interruption
of the times, which silenc'd his profession, would have given a
stop to his rise had he been of another disposition.‘’

The editor of the 1683 edition of R. Moket’s “ De politeia ec-
clesiae Anglicanae '' says of him “exteris certe non minus quam
nostratibus natum ..... scriptis suis de jure gentium et civili, ubi-
que clarissimus, gentis nostrae decus et ornamentum.''

Zouche was a good specimen of the Civilian who was produced
at Oxford, while the thorough drill of the old system of legal
training‚ as revived by the impulse given to it by the Italian
refugee, Alberico Gentili‚ still lasted on. Zouche and his senior
contemporary, Arthur Duck. both pupils of John Budden, who
had succeeded Gentili in the Regius Professomhip, are the last
of the old race of Oxford Civilians whose writings still enjoy
European reputation.
