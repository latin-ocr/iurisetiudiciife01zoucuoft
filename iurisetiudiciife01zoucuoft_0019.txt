INTRODUCTION.

I.
A BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR.*

Richard Zouche was born in 1589 at Atistey 111 Wiltshire. His
father, Francis Zouche, Lord of the Mamor there, and at one time
Member of Parliarnent‚ was son of Sir John, who was a younger
son of John, Eighth Lord Zouche of Haryngworth‚ whose family
claimed descent from the Dukes of Brittany. His mother was,
perhaps, Phillipa‚ daughter of George Ludlow‚ of Hill Deverell‚
Wilts.

Richard was elected Scholar of &Vinchester in 1601, Scholar of
New College, Oxford, in 1607, and Fellow in 1609. He took the
degree of Β. C. L. in 1614, and that of D. C. L. in 1619; having
been already, on January 3oth, 1618, admitted to be an Advocate
of the College of Doctors Commoris, hard by St. Paul's Cathedral‚
the members of which, who must all have graduated 111 Civil Law
at Oxford or Cambridge, enjoyed, down to the year 1858, the right
of exclusive audience in the Ecclesiastical Courts and the Court
os Admiralty.†

Zouche does not, however⁷ seem to have laid himself out for
practice in London till a later period of his career. In 1620 he
received the appointment of Regius Professor of Civil Law at
Oxfmd, 111 succession to John Budden, who had followed in that

office, after acting as his deputy‚ the famous Italian refugee,
Alberico Gentili.
