On the page following the author's address Ad Lectorem‚
there will be found the original list of Errata, the length of
which is attributed to the imperfectioris of the copy supplied by
the author, and to his absence from Oxford. A careful reading
of the text has, however, shown that this list is by no means ex-
haustive. It has therefore been thought desirable to print at the
end of the book a more complete list, in which the errata orig-
inally indicated are incorporated with those to which attention
has now been called for the first time.

The editor has been fortunate enough to secure the services, as
translator of the “ Jus Feciale‚'' of his friend Mr. J. L. Brierly‚
B. C. L., Barrister-at-law a'nd Fellow of All Souls College, who
is also mainly responsible for the further list of Ery-ata, and for
the Index of authors cited.
