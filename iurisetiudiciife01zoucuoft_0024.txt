ZOUCHE'S wR1T1NGs.

The literary output of Zouche, especially if we remember his
life-long occupations as Professor, Advocate and Judge, was as
surprising in amount as it was varied in character. His first and
somewhat juvenile, publication (No. 1 in the list which follows)
was a poem descriptive of Europe, Asia and Africa, after the
manner of the “ Periegesis ’' of Dionysius. In a euphuistic pref-
ace the author apologises for his poetical venture, having known
“some whose credit hath challenged respect, exceeding strong
in prejudice against the composing and reading such trifles.‘’
In maturer years Zouche attempted a play (No. 6), if it be
rightly attributed to him, “ intended to be performed before an
Academical audience,‘' fitted, indeed, for no other, since the
dramatis personae are such bloodless abstractions as “ Fallacy,''
“Opposition,” and “Ambiguity.'' At a much later date, he
produced a little book of logical, rhetorical, and ethical maxims
(No. 14). Most of his writings were, however, upon the study
and the practice of the Civil Law. Several of these were hand-
books for disputations at the University (Nos. 12, 15), and two
were of a polemical cast, dealing, respectively, with the case of
Sa, already mentioned, and with Sir Edward Coke's views upon
Admiralty Jurisdiction (Nos. 13, 16). But his most important
achievement was the mapping out of the whole field of law, and
the subsequent examination in detail of its various departments.
The “ Elementa Jurisprudentiae ’' (No. 2), although in termin-
ology wholly, and in substance mainly, a setting forth of Roman
Law, is intended to supply a generally applicable scheme of legal
science, distributed under the two main heads of “ Jus '’ and “ Ju-
dicium ‘' (or “ Rights '³ and “ Remedies ”). In accordance with
the method which he had thus prescribed to himself, Zouche
