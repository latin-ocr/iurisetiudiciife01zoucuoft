scheme approximately suggested by that followed by the Roman
jurists‚ in distributing the topics of Private Law. Alike in Part I
and in Part ΙΙ, and in each with reference both to Peace and War,
the discussion turns successively upon “ Persons‚'' “ Property,''

both kinds of knowledge, he gives credit in one of his Dedications
to the training which he had received in the two famous Wic-
camical Colleges: “ a pueritia ultra adolescentiam humanioribus
literis et juris studio institutus.'’

(5) But the work abounds not only in “ wise saws '² from the
Greeks and Romans. but, also, to a degree previously unusual,
in “modern instances‚’' gathered from European history3 as is
