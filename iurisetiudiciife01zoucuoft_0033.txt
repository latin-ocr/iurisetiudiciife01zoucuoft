Christianity‚'' “the justice of War against the Indians,'' “the
Law os War and Military Discipline,'' “ the Alliances and Trea-
ties of Princes,'‘ “ the Law of War ''; till we corneto the treatise
of Grotius, who does indeed deal with the law both of war and of
peace, but subordinates the latter to the former.

Zouche was the first to conceive of the topic as a whole, and
to recognize that war, with Which his predecessors had mainly
busied themselves, is but a means, whereby, in the last resort, the
rights which Nations enjoy in time of peace may be vindicated.

(2) He bestowed upon his topic the really descriptive title
which, in its translated forms, has largely superseded the ambigu-
ous term “ Jus Gentium ⁷' (still lingering as “ Droit des Gens,”
“ Volkerrecht’⁷), by Which it had begun to be known. After
examining the ambiguities which beset this term when employed
to describe the body of generally received rules which govern the
relations of State to State (“ quod inter Principes vel Populos
diversarum gentium communiter intercedit '')‚ he announces his
intention of giving to that body of rules, partially dealt with in the
Roman Jus Feciale, the name “ Jus inter Gentes '' (“ Jus inter
gentes placet appellare ''). This collocation of words had, indeed,
occurred, as it were accidentally, here and there in the pages of
earlier writers, such as Victoria, Vasquez, SuareZ, and Grotius,
but was now for the first time deliberately adopted as the name of
a science which, as a whole, had previously been nameless. The
subsequent history of the term is well known. The Chancellor
D'Aguessew, in 1716, commends to his son the study of “ ce qu’on
appelle le Droit des Gens, ou, pour parler plus correctement, par·
ceque le nom de Droit des Gens a un autre sens, le Droit entre
les Nations ”3 so to the same effect, in 1740, the Abbe de Saint
Pierre. But it was Jeremy Bentham who, in his “ Principles
of Morals and Legislation,'' 1789, secured the general adoption
of Zouche's suggestion, by coining the term “ International
Law,’' as “calculated to express, in a more significant way, the
branch of law which goes commonly under the name of the Law
of Nations.'’
