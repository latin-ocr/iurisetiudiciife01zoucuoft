(Jus) and “ Remedies '³ (Judicium). One might thus be led to
hope that Zouche had seized, and adopted into his system, the
division of subject-matterwhich has contributed so much to clear-
ness of statement in modern books upon International Law: that
namely, between “ Peace ‘' and “ War ”3 in other words, between
the Rights of Nations. and the Remedy, in the last resort, for the
infringement of those Rights. This unfortunately turns out not to
be the case. The nomenclature employed in his previous treatises
to distinguish between Rights and Remedies is, indeed, still
retained. Part I is headed “ De Jure inter Gentes,'' and Part ΙΙ
“ De Judicio inter Gentes ”; but the contents of these Parts do not
correspond to their titles. Both Parts alike treat both of Peace
and of War <Part I of Peace in sects. 1-5, of War in sects. 6-103
Part ΙΙ of Peace in sects. ῐ-ς, of War in sects. 6-10) 3 the distinc-
tion between the contents of the two Parts being, as we are warned
in the Add ress to the Resides, between rules which are fairly well
established (“ quae sunt minus dubitati juris ”), which, whether
they relate to Peace orto War, he places in Part 13 and debatable
matters (“ quae videbantur juris controversi '’), which, whether
they relate to Pence or to War, he discusses as open questions, with
arguments pro and con„ in Part II. It might indeed be supposed
from the mentions with which this Part commences, of War,
Arbitration, Litigation and Pressure of Public Opinion‚ as the
modes in which disputes are settled “between Princes and peo-
ples which acknowledge no superior‚’' that, under the heading
“ De Judicio inter gentes,'' we are about to read only of Proce-
dure, having this object in view3 but one soon discovers that this
is not the case.

Apart, however, from such confusion as arises from the inept
classification of topics, just described, the book possesses merits
which more than justify the respectful attention which it has
received.

of the Law of Nations, in works upon “ Reprisals,’‘ “ the Duel,'‘
