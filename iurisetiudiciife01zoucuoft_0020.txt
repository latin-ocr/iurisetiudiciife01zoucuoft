In 1622 Zouche married Sarah, daughter of John Hart‚ of the
family of that name settled at Brill in Oxfordshire, a Proctor in
Doctors Commons3 '³² and having thus vacated his New College
FeIlowship, entered himself in the following year as a Gentle-
man Commoner at Wadham College‚ but in 1625 was appointed
Principal of St. Alban Han, which has no longer an independ—
ent existence, having been in 1882 annexed to the neighbouring
Merton College. Through the influence of his cousin Edward,
the eleventh and last Lord Zouche of the older creation and
Lord Warden of the Cinque Pom, he had been in 1621 and 1624
elected M. P. for Hythe.

It is not easy to understand how Zouche, especially in those days
of difficult locomotion‚ managed to combine his work at Oxford
with such success in his profession, hastened doubtless by the busi-
ness which his father-in-law was able to put in his way, as pro-

to the Judgeship of the Admiralty‚ a post which he contrived to
hold till deprived of it, for political reasons, in 1649: certain,
however, it is that he was also for many years a prominent figure
at Oxford. He took a leading part in the Laudian codification of
the Statutes of the University (1629-1633), though we hear of his
being frequently called away from it, “ the London Term having
begun‚’' by his employment at Doctors Commons. In 1632 he
became Chancellor of the Diocese, and from about 1649 held the
office of “ Assessor‚⁷' practically Judge Ordinary, of the privi-
leged Court of the Chancellor of the University.† In 1658 he was
an unsuccessful candidate for the Keepership of the University
Archives. He must also have, all the while, discharged dili-
