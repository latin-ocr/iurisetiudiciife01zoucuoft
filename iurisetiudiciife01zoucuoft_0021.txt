gently, though often by deputy, the duties of his Professorship;
as will appear from the list of his writings‚ many of which were
obviously, and several expressly, composed for the guidance of
his pupils.

In the civil troubles, Zouche's sympathies were on the side of
the King, and his departure from London for Oxford in 1643,
without paying a Parliamentary subsidy, was followed by a dis-
tress levied on the furniture of his chambers in Doctors Commons.
In 1646, he was one of the negotiators, on behalf of the Royalist
forces in Oxford, of the articles for the surrender of the City to
Fairfax; under which he, and the other “ malignants'’ there,
were permitted, within six months, without taking the covenant,

visitors were also induced to restore his son Richard to a Demy-

Zouche's position during the remainder of the commonwealth
time continued to be ambiguous. In 1649, the judgeship of the

On the other hand, he was, in 1654, placed upon a special com-

Judges, three Doctors of Civil Law, and three laymen, for the
trial of Don Pantaleone Sa, the brother of the Portuguese Am-
bassador, for a murder committed in the course of a brawl at
the Exchange. Sa was condemned and executed, and one of the
