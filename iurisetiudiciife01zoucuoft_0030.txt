III.
THE WORK NOW REPRODUCED.

It has been already explained that the “ Jus Feciale‚’' published
in 1650, was one, and the last, of a series of seven monographs in
which Zouche dealt with various departments of law, in accord-
ance with a plan which he had prescribed to himself, and had
explained, twenty-one years previously, in his “ Elementa Juris-
prudentiae, definitionibus, regulis, et sententiis selectioribus Juris
Civilis illustrata.’‘ In order to appreciate the later, it is there-
fore necessary to have some acquaintance with the earlier work,
of which the learned Bishop Sanderson said to a friend that the
“Elementa Jurisprudentiae was a book he could say without
book3 and that no wise man could read it too often, or love or
commend it too much.‘’ In it Zouche maps out the whole field
of Law according to a system of his own·

In Part I he treats, first, of the “ Object” of Jurisprudence
(Jurisprudentiae Finis), Which is the enforcement of “Justice,”
the principles of which are derived from Jus Naturale, Jus Gen-
tium, and Jus Civile,· secondly, of the “ Subject '' of Jurispru-
dence (subjectum in quo versatur), i. e. “ Human Intercourse ’⁷
(communio humana universa), which takes place between: (1)
private individuals, (2) Sovereign and subject, (3) persons in
special relations, ecclesiastical, military and nautical, (4) Sover-
eign and Sovereign (communio qeneralis inter diversos Principes
et Respublicas), each of these four topics involving the consider-
ation of personae, res, actus (here he somewhat misapplies the
Roman classification of personae, res, actiones); lastly, of the
“ Means ‘' of Jurisprudence, i. e. the methods by which Justice is
brought to bear upon human intercourse (quibus Finis in Sub-
jectum inducitur), of which the principal is Iudicium, or as we
should say, “ Procedure.’' ³¹*

 

 

ἦ In this distribution oi his subject one seems to trace the influence of the “paratitla in Pan-
dectas” of Wesenbecius (1566).
